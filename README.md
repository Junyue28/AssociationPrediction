The  circ2Traits dataset and partial comparison method code can be found in the following references：

[lanbiolab/CompareExperiment: This is the code and the data of a underview paper named "Benchmarking computational methods for predicting circRNA-disease asssociations", which contains 10 methods and 5 collected datasets. The detail will be introduced after the paper is accepted.](https://github.com/lanbiolab/CompareExperiment)
